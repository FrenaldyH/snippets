# My Code Snippets ðŸš€

Welcome to my personal code snippets repository! This collection contains a variety of code snippets I've created to speed up my workflow, primarily for competitive programming and general C++ development.

Feel free to use them to boost your own productivity!

## ðŸ”§ How to Use These Snippets (for VS Code)

These snippets are designed for Visual Studio Code. To use them, follow these steps:

1.  **Open VS Code Snippets:**
    * On Windows/Linux: `File` > `Preferences` > `Configure User Snippets`.
    * On macOS: `Code` > `Preferences` > `Configure User Snippets`.
2.  **Select the Language:** Choose the language for which you want to add the snippets (e.g., `cpp.json` for C++).
3.  **Copy & Paste:** Open the corresponding `.json` file in this repository (e.g., [`cpp.json`](./cpp.json)). Copy the entire content of the file and paste it into the VS Code snippet file you just opened.
4.  **Save** the file, and you're ready to go!

**Important:** To trigger a snippet, you must type the prefix which always starts with the letter **`F`**. For example, to get the "Greatest Common Divisor" snippet, you would type `Fgcd` and press Enter.
